    "LLMs output generative text one single token at a time. This makes it hard for users to visualize multiple possible continuations of a token. A token being a word or a sub-word. This limits the user's ability to interact with multiple branching options, especially in creative writing. Our goal for this project was to create an interface that would let the user explore multiple 'lookahead' completions of tokens interactively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Hugging Face .generate() API does not support lookahead branching directly. It is a function that abstracts the low-level implementation of token-by-token generation. With the .generate() API, we cannot intervene after each token to explore multiple possible next tokens. It produces and outputs one sequence at a time. And because of this reason, we needed to custom implement this inference pipeline ourselves for the lookahead generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lookahead generation is a technique to explore multiple possible next-token continuations of a prompt. This allows the user to see and choose from several potential paths instead of just a single prediction. This enables dynamic user involvement by allowing user to steer the direction of the piece they are writing.\n",

    "Technical Goal: We already had starter code for the lookahead generation logic from Professor Arnold's existing work. However, his lookahead sequence was limited to 2 next tokens for each branch. One of our main technical goals was to expand upon his existing backend logic code to support more than 2 next tokens and to evaluate and validate its accuracy. \n",
